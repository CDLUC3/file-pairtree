# Set up a big "find" expression that depends on these features of GNU find:
#   -regex for high-functioning, wholepath matching
#   -printf to tag files/dirs found with certain characteristics
#
# The basic idea is to walk a given hierarchy and tag stuff that looks
# like an object.  Mainstream objects are encapsulated in directory names
# of three characters or more, but we still have to detect the edge cases.
# All candidate object cases are printed on a line with the pairpath
# (ppath) first (as primary sort field), the tagged case, and the file/dir
# name found at the end of the ppath.
#
# XXXXXXXX better tags needed
#	NS=Non-Shorty directory (normal object)
#	UF=Unencapsulated File (encaps. warning),
#	PM=Post-Morty Shorty or Morty encountered (encaps. warning)
#	UG=Unencapsulated Group (encaps. warning)
#       EP=Empty Pairpath (indicator)
#
# The output of the 'find' is sorted (important) so that leaves descending
# from a given ppath cluster in groups.  The resulting groups are used to
# figure out how best to detect and repair any encapsulation problems.
# We offer xxx to repair encapsulation problems because they're non-trivial
# to detect (ie, there will be pairtree walkers that don't detect them) and
# we want to encourage proper encapsulation for the sake of interoperability.
#
# One odd case is an object right at the root of a pairtree, which means
# an empty path, hence an empty identifier.  Because systems frequently
# reserve special meaning for an empty or root value, and they/we might
# want to put something at that special location (eg, an object describing
# the pairtree), we will detect and count it as an object; its meaning and
# (il)legality is up to the implementor.  This has the nice side-effect
# that we'll have no fatal errors in processing a pairtree.
#
